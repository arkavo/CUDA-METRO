Skyrmions, which are topological, particle-like localized structures, show significant fundamental research value in the field of physics and materials and are also regarded as novel information carriers that have the potential for use in developing high-density, low-power, and multi-functional spintronic devices. In this Perspective, we first overview the development, structure, and materials of skyrmions. Subsequently, we focus on the recent progress in skyrmion devices for memory and logic applications and discuss their challenges and prospects.},

	abstract = {Merons are nontrivial topological spin textures highly relevant for many phenomena in solid state physics. Despite their importance, direct observation of such vortex quasiparticles is scarce and has been limited to a few complex materials. Here, we show the emergence of merons and antimerons in recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) CrCl3 at zero magnetic field. We show their entire evolution from pair creation, their diffusion over metastable domain walls, and collision leading to large magnetic monodomains. Both quasiparticles are stabilized spontaneously during cooling at regions where in-plane magnetic frustration takes place. Their dynamics is determined by the interplay between the strong in-plane dipolar interactions and the weak out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy stabilising a vortex core within a radius of 8–10 nm. Our results push the boundary to what is currently known about non-trivial spin structures in 2D magnets and open exciting opportunities to control magnetic domains via topological quasiparticles.},

	abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions, which are topologically protected tiny spin textures, have emerged as information carriers in energy-efficient logic and memory devices. Skyrmions are commonly realized by inducing large Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) in the interface of heavy metal heterolayers. With the advent of two-dimensional magnetism, it is being envisioned to host intrinsic skyrmions in a monolayer, which will be free from any interfacial defect and stacking order. Here using high-fidelity exchange-correlation functional-based first-principles calculations, we investigate such a possibility in methodically designed non-centrosymmetric MXene structures. From a search space of about 3000 materials, our customized high-throughput computational pipeline systematically harnesses out-of-the-plane and in-plane magnetism along with strong DMI to realize typical ‘unipolar’ skyrmions in 78 materials and exotic ‘bipolar’ skyrmions in 13 materials. Micromagnetic and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations further reveal that skyrmions in some of these materials may be stable at room temperature without any external magnetic field. Our study may pave the way for the practical realization of skyrmions-based information technology.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the classical Heisenberg model has become the de facto tool to estimate the Curie temperature (TC) of two-dimensional (2D) magnets. As an alternative, here we develop data-driven models for the five most common crystal types, considering the isotropic and anisotropic exchange of up to four nearest neighbors and the single-ion anisotropy. We sample the 20-dimensional Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian and conceive a bisection-based MC technique to simulate a quarter of a million materials for training deep neural networks, which yield testing R2 scores of nearly 0.99. Since 2D magnetism has a natural tendency toward low TC, learning-from-data is combined with data-from-learning to ensure a nearly uniform final data distribution over a wide range of TC (10–1,000 K). Global and local analysis of the features confirms the models’ interpretability. We also demonstrate that the TC can be accurately estimated by a purely first-principles-based approach, free from any empirical corrections.},
