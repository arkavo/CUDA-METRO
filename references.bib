	abstract = {A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigating such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.},

	abstract = {Skyrmions have received considerable attention in various studies since the experimental observation in magnetic materials in 2009. Skyrmions, which are topological, particle-like localized structures, show significant fundamental research value in the field of physics and materials and are also regarded as novel information carriers that have the potential for use in developing high-density, low-power, and multi-functional spintronic devices. In this Perspective, we first overview the development, structure, and materials of skyrmions. Subsequently, we focus on the recent progress in skyrmion devices for memory and logic applications and discuss their challenges and prospects.},
